# cookies-notification contribution guidelines

We follow a systematic Git Workflow

  * Create a fork of this repo.
    *  you can do this by pressing the fork button
  * Clone your fork of your repo to your local maching
    * `git clone "url of repo"`
  * [Add Upstream to your clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)
  * When creating a branch please indicate issue, and add the issue number
  * Changes made must be on that branch. Commits on master would directly be closed.
  * Make sure that before you create a new branch for new changes,[syncing with   upstream](https://help.github.com/en/github/  collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) is neccesary.
