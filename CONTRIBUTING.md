## Commits
We follow a systematic Git Workflow:

* Create a fork of this repo.
    > You can do this by pressing the fork button.
* Clone your fork of your repo to your local maching.
* Add [Upstream](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork) to your clone.
* When creating a branch please indicate issue, and add the issue number.
* Changes made must be on that branch. Commits on master would directly be closed.
* Make sure that before you create a new branch for new changes, [syncing with upstream](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) is neccesary.
